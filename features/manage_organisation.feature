    | Pavel     | Taylor | pavel | secret   | admin                     | Greenwich Steiner School |

    When I follow "Owners"
    Then I should not see "Pavel Taylor"

    Given the following users:
    | givenName | sn  | uid      | password | puavoEduPersonAffiliation | school                   |
    | Jane      | Doe | jane.doe | secret   | admin                     | Greenwich Steiner School |
    When I follow "Owners"
    And I change "jane.doe" user type to "student"
    And I follow "Add" on the "Jane Doe" user
    And I should see "Organisation owner access rights can be added only if the type of the user is admin"

  Scenario: Owners can't remove their own owner rights

    | givenName | sn   | uid    | password | puavoEduPersonAffiliation | school                   |
    | Donald    | Duck | donald | 313      | admin                     | Greenwich Steiner School |
    When I follow "Owners"
    And I follow "Add" on the "Donald Duck" user
    Then I should see "Donald Duck is now an owner of this organisation"
    Given I am logged in as "donald" with password "313"
    When I follow "Owners"
    Then I should see "(You can't remove your own owner-level rights)"

  Scenario: .img extension is removed from desktop image names
    When I follow "About"
    And I follow "Edit..."
    And I fill in "Desktop Image" with "example_image.img"
    And I press "Update"
    # All "I should see" and "I should not see" checks are just simple
    # substring searches. If there's "example_image.img" on the page,
    # then it will match to "example_image". So we must check for the
    # absence of the extension itself.
    Then I should not see ".img"
    When I follow "Edit..."
    And I fill in "Desktop Image" with "example_image_2"
    And I press "Update"
    Then I should see "example_image_2"
